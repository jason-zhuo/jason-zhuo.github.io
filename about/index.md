##1.Introduction
####I’m a Ph.D. student from School of Computer Science and Engineering in University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), supervised by Prof. Xiaosong Zhang and Prof. Jingzhong Zhang. I was an undergraduate at UESTC from 2009 to 2013. And before that, I spent three great years in No.7 high school in Chengdu.


##2.Research Interests 
<li>Machine learning: Clustering algorithm, Classification algorithm</li>
<li>Network theory: Complex network </li>
<li>Network security: Traffic classification, Security & Privacy, Anonymous Communication, Malware detection and modeling</li>

##3.Current Ongoing Projects:

Topic: Traffic analysis and classification 


>####Description: We implemented a new multi granularity traffic analyzing platform, which has the advantage to extract hidden features exist among flows or packets. Future works include revising current platform and adding more plugins into our platform, such as botnet detection plugins, anonymous traffic analyze plugins etc.

Topic: Data field Clustering

>####Description: A new dynamic clustering algorithm, which does not need to tune the parameters. And it improves the efficiency of traditional data field hierarchical clustering algorithm. Future works include adding K-D support to our algorithm, and applying it to traffic flow clustering.
